                Wordlists are used in dictionary attacks. Hashview comes preloaded with one wordlist, but you can upload more by clicking the 'Upload Wordlist' button to the left or by dropping the files to /[install path]/control/wordlists/. Hashview will also automatically create a Magic Wordlist that contains unique set of all wordlist enteries as well as all cracked passwords.
