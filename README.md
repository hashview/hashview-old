Your pull request should fully describe the functionality you are adding/removing or the problem you are solving. Regardless of whether your patch modifies one line or one thousand lines, you must describe what has prompted and/or motivated the change.

Solve only one problem in each pull request. If you're fixing a bug and adding a new feature, you need to make two separate pull requests. If you're fixing three bugs, you need to make three separate pull requests. If you're adding four new features, you need to make four separate pull requests. So on, and so forth.

If your patch fixes a bug, please be sure there is an [issue](https://github.com/hashview/hashview) open for the bug before submitting a pull request.

The project lead has the ultimate authority in deciding whether to accept or reject a pull request. Do not be discouraged if your pull request is rejected!
